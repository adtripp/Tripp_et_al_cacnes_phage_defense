This repository contains all code necessary to reproduce the analyses described in:

*Citation: Phage-mediated lysis does not determine Cutibacterium acnes colonization on human skin

This project is part of my postdoctoral research in the Lieberman Lab (https://lieberman.science/research/).

Overview

The analyses are grouped into three parts:

C. acnes genomic analysis

C. acnes liquid phage infectivity assay

C. acnes and its phage analysis in skin metagenomes
