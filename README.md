# Phage-mediated lysis does not determine Cutibacterium acnes colonization on human skin

This repository contains all code necessary to reproduce the analyses described in:

**Tripp, A. D.**, Qu, E. B., Baker, J. S., Mancuso, C., Roux, S., Hussain, F. A., & Lieberman, T. D. “Phage-mediated lysis does not determine Cutibacterium acnes colonization on human skin”. bioRxiv, 2025-09.



This project is part of my doctoral research in the Lieberman Lab (https://lieberman.science/research/).

Overview

The analyses are grouped into three parts:

C. acnes genomic analysis

C. acnes liquid phage infectivity assay

C. acnes and its phage analysis in skin metagenomes
